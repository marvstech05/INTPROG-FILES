1. What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?

readyState indicates the current state of the request.
It changes as the request progresses through different phases:

0 = UNSENT (request not initialized)

1 = OPENED (server connection established)

2 = HEADERS_RECEIVED (request received)

3 = LOADING (processing request)

4 = DONE (request finished and response is ready)

status represents the HTTP response code returned by the server (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server error).
You usually check status only when readyState === 4.


2. How can you make the request asynchronous?

- By setting the third parameter of the xhr.open() method to true:

= xhr.open("GET", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1", true);


Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?

- Asynchronous communication allows the browser to continue responding to user actions (e.g., scrolling, clicking buttons) while data is being fetched.
It improves performance and user experience by preventing the page from freezing or becoming unresponsive during server requests.
