
XML Reflection
    Throughout this exercise period, I got to know that strict syntax rules are definitely 
followed by XML like having single root element and closed tags. When I tried to validate 
the file online, I was enlightened about the fact that a pin-point mistake in the file would 
result in numerous errors. After correcting them all and checking again, to get the message 
"No errors were found," I realized how structure and validation are significant for sharing data between 
different systems. This task has increased my production and evaluation skills for XML files. 

What are the basic rules of XML you applied in this lab?
    -​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ I have elaborated on the most basic XML rules by myself such as having a single root element (<students>), 
correct nesting of tags, making sure that every opening tag is followed by a closing one, and element names 
being case sensitive. Besides, I was also concerned that the XML declaration is at the top and that the format 
is not only executable but also human-readable.

 Why does XML need a single root element?
    - As XML is a file that has to be wrapped into a single root element, it is the main container of all the 
other elements that are in the document. Hence, the XML file has a distinctly defined tree structure and can 
be read and parsed by machines or applications.

 How does XML ensure interoperability?
    - XML ensures interoperability by sticking to a non-platform and human-readable text format that can be 
easily understood by different software and systems. The use of standard syntax makes the data very attractive 
to be easily transferable, storable, and processable by any technology, programming language, or ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌platform.
